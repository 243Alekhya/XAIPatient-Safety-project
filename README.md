# Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Patient Safety A Review of Application in Pharmacovigilance
Welcome to the XAI patient safety project! This repository presents a comprehensive review of the application of Explainable AI (XAI) in the field of pharmacovigilance. While AI is increasingly being utilized in drug surveillance, patient safety, and predicting adverse drug reactions, the integration of XAI remains limited. From an initial pool of 781 studies, only 25 met the selection criteria for this research, focusing on the use of clinical, registry, and knowledge data to explore drug treatment, side effects, and drug interactions. Utilizing models such as tree models, neural networks, and graph models, this review identifies key challenges in employing XAI for pharmacovigilance, with an emphasis on the future potential and need for explainability in AI-driven medical research.
